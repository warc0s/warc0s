## ðŸš€ Projects

### [Fox-Detector](https://github.com/warc0s/Fox-Detector)
*A Keras-based binary classifier utilizing DenseNet121 to differentiate between fox and non-fox images. This was my first advanced deep learning project, enhancing my skills in data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. I apologize for any inefficiencies in the implementation and am eager to receive feedback and suggestions to improve my work.*

### [Gather-Tracker](https://github.com/Warc0s/Gather-Tracker)
*A JavaScript script for monitoring user activities and messaging within a Gather Town office, integrated with Telegram for real-time notifications. This project strengthened my abilities in JavaScript, API integration, and real-time data handling.*
